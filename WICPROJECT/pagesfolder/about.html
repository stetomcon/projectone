      <article>
        WIC FINDER is an application to help people find vendors that are in
        Connecticut's Women Infant & Children program. One simply goes to the
        homepage and you can either type in your city or zipcode, and all the
        vendors of either location will populate. There is also a new section
        "Farmer's Market" where one can also locate farmer markets that are in
        the program. Because there arent that many, the easiest way to find
        one's local farmer's market is by counties. In the Drop Down you pick
        your county and the markets, time and websites that are in the program
        will populate.There are also two other pages, one is the about page,
        which will explain what the applicatin is for, and the other one is
        information on CT's program itself.

      <h2>API being used</h2>
      <article>
        There are two API's that were used for this application. Both came from
        CT's Data website. "https://data.ct.gov". The farmers market one is
        "https://data.ct.gov/dataset/Farmers-Markets/qkcc-8trv" and the second
        one is
        "https://data.ct.gov/Health-and-Human-Services/WIC-Authorized-Vendors/jk32-cd4i"
